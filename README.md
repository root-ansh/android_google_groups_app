# Google groups web view

A very basic android app which does nothing except opening https://www.groups.google.com
Made this many years ago trying to learn chrome custom tabs/ splash screen best practices and dealing with college's irritating google group (Why can't they use discord or what's app group for pete's sake?)
My laptop is gonna soon die so uploading here
